# VERTO PITCH DECK

**The P2P Creator Streaming Marketplace**

---

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### One-Liner Value Proposition

**Netflix for indie creators, powered by peer-to-peer technology.**

One subscription replaces scattered Patreon pledges. Creators keep 85-90% of revenue. Zero ads. Zero platform manipulation.

---

## 2. PROBLEM: THE CREATOR ECONOMY'S TRIPLE CRISIS

### Who Has This Problem?

- **304 million creators worldwide** seeking sustainable monetization
- **71% of Gen Z viewers** frustrated with ad-bloated platforms
- **Small-to-mid-sized content creators** trapped between expensive self-hosting and exploitative platforms

### The Three Pain Points:

#### 🔴 The Platform Tax (45-50%)

- YouTube takes 45% of ad revenue
- Twitch takes 50% of subscriptions
- Patreon charges 5-12% + payment processing fees
- **Result:** Creators need 3-5 platforms just to survive, fragmenting their audience

#### 🔴 Discovery is Broken

- Algorithms prioritize clickbait over quality
- Small creators can't compete with corporate content budgets
- Viewers spend hours searching across 10+ platforms
- **No way for independent creators to cross-promote or bundle together**

#### 🔴 The Ad-Bloat Paradox

- Platforms charge subscriptions AND serve ads (YouTube Premium ≠ truly ad-free creator experience)
- Creators lose creative control to sponsor demands
- Privacy invasion through tracking-based ad systems
- **44% streaming churn rate in 2025-2026** due to subscription fatigue

### Why Current Solutions Fail:

| Platform         | Missing Element                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **YouTube**      | Takes 45%, algorithm buries quality content, ads disrupt experience |
| **Patreon**      | No discovery, no bundling, creators operate as isolated islands     |
| **Nebula**       | Invite-only exclusivity, no open marketplace for new creators       |
| **Uscreen/Muvi** | White-label silos—creators still do 100% of marketing alone         |

---

## 3. SOLUTION: THE P2P CREATOR MALL

### Product Overview

Verto is a **decentralized streaming marketplace** where verified creators host ad-free, HD content. Users subscribe to individual creators OR curated "Packs" (bundles of creators), creating a modern unbundled cable TV experience.

### How It Works

#### FOR CREATORS:

✅ **Keep 85-90% of Revenue** (vs. 50-55% on YouTube/Twitch)  
✅ **Desktop Upload App** (Wails + Go): Lightning-fast local uploads, 4x faster than YouTube  
✅ **Collaborative Bundling**: Team up with other creators to sell "Packs"

- *Example:* 5 coding educators create a "Full-Stack Dev Pack" for $12/month → viewers save $13/month vs. individual subscriptions
- Revenue split is transparent and creator-defined  
  ✅ **Linear Scheduling**: Program VOD content to "air" at specific times (like TV channels)
- Creates appointment viewing without needing to stream live
- Builds community ritual ("New episode Fridays at 8pm")

#### FOR VIEWERS:

✅ **One Wallet, Infinite Choices**

- Subscribe to individual creators ($3-8/month)
- Grab Packs for bundled savings ($10-20 for 3-8 creators)
- Mega Pack: $30/month unlimited access (revenue goes to creators you watch most)  
  ✅ **100% Ad-Free, Zero Tracking**: Pure subscription model  
  ✅ **Discovery Feed**: Algorithm-free chronological feed from subscribed creators  
  ✅ **Viewer-as-Curator**: Create custom Packs, earn 5% referral commission
- *Example:* Superfan creates "Best Science Educators 2026" Pack → earns passive income

### The Network Effect Flywheel

```
More creators → More bundling options → Better viewer value → 
Higher retention → More revenue per creator → Attracts more creators
```

### Unique Value Propositions:

1. **First marketplace enabling inter-creator collaboration** (no competitor allows this)
2. **P2P infrastructure** slashes hosting costs by 80% vs. traditional CDNs
3. **Blockchain payment rails** automate revenue splits (no manual accounting)
4. **Linear scheduling** recreates "TV feel" for community engagement

## 4. MARKET OPPORTUNITY

### Market Size (2026 Data)

| Metric  | Value     | Definition                                                     |
| ------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TAM** | **$250B** | Global creator economy (all monetization methods)              |
| **SAM** | **$45B**  | Subscription-based creator platforms (excludes pure ad models) |
| **SOM** | **$2.3B** | Educational & premium niche creators (Year 3 target)           |

### Growth Drivers:

- **304M creators globally** (LinkedIn Economic Graph, 2025)
- **44% streaming churn rate** in 2025-2026 (Antenna Data) → viewers desperate for consolidation
- **71% of Gen Z** prefers ad-free content and willing to pay premium (Deloitte Digital Media Trends 2025)
- **$1.2B invested in creator economy startups** in 2024-2025 (Pitchbook)

### Addressable Customer Segments:

1. **Primary:** Educational creators (coding, language, fitness, finance) → 45M creators
2. **Secondary:** Independent filmmakers, podcasters, investigative journalists → 30M creators
3. **Tertiary:** Gaming streamers, lifestyle vloggers → 80M creators

### Market Validation:

- Patreon grew from $0 to $1B+ GMV in 8 years with ZERO bundling features
- Nebula (invite-only platform) reached 650K subscribers in 4 years
- Substack (text-only) hit $25M ARR in 3 years
- **Verto combines bundling + video + P2P economics = 10x larger TAM**

---

## 5. WHY NOW: THE PERFECT STORM

### 1. 🔥 Platform Trust Crisis (2024-2026)

- **YouTube's ad-tier shift:** Even Premium subscribers now see creator-injected sponsors
- **Patreon fee increases:** Raised rates by 2.9% in Q4 2025 → sparked creator exodus
- **23% of top creators actively seeking alternatives** (Creator Economy Report, 2025)

### 2. 💰 Web3 Infrastructure Maturity

- **Ethereum Layer 2 transaction costs dropped 95%** (2024-2025)
  - Payment splits now cost $0.02 vs. $3.50 in 2022
- **IPFS/Arweave decentralized storage** now rivals CDN performance at 1/10th the cost
- **Blockchain = instant, automated revenue splits** (no waiting 30-60 days like traditional platforms)

### 3. 📺 Unbundling Demand Proven

- Netflix/Disney+/HBO Max fragmentation proved consumers want **curated bundles, not 12 separate subscriptions**
- Cable TV → Streaming Boom → Streaming Fatigue → **Verto's Re-Bundling Phase**
- Consumers spent avg. $87/month on streaming in 2025 (up from $47 in 2020) → unsustainable

### 4. 🚀 Creator Tools Commoditized

- Live transcoding APIs (Mux, Cloudflare Stream) now $0.005/minute
- Go-based backends enable 10x faster video processing than legacy Python/Node stacks
- Desktop frameworks (Wails, Tauri) make native app development 5x faster

### Timing Validation:

- **Right after peak platform dissatisfaction** (Q4 2025 Patreon/YouTube backlash)
- **Before competitors realize bundling is the unlock** (Patreon/Substack still don't offer this)
- **Web3 infrastructure mature enough** to handle millions of micro-transactions

- **1,500 creators** @ avg $550/month revenue = $825K/month × 15% platform fee = **$123K MRR** (~$1.5M ARR)
- Target: Reach 1,500 creators by **Month 18**

---

## 7. BUSINESS MODEL

### Revenue Streams

#### Primary: Platform Transaction Fee (85-90% to creators)

- Verto keeps **10-15%** of all subscription revenue
- **85% to creators** (distributed based on Pack agreements if bundled)
- **5% to viewer-curators** (if subscription came via referral)

**Example Revenue Split:**

```
Viewer pays $12/month for "Full-Stack Dev Pack" (5 creators):
├─ $10.20 to creators (85%) → split as they agreed
├─ $1.20 to Verto (10%) → infrastructure costs
└─ $0.60 to curator (5%) → referral commission
```

#### Secondary: Creator Subscription Tiers

| Tier            | Price     | Features                                                                  | Target Audience                 |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Free**        | $0/month  | 10 videos, 1GB storage, Verto branding                                    | Hobbyists testing platform      |
| **Creator Pro** | $15/month | Unlimited videos, custom branding, analytics dashboard                    | Semi-pro educators, coaches     |
| **Studio**      | $50/month | Multi-user accounts, API access, priority transcoding, white-label option | Bootcamps, agencies, publishers |

**Projected Creator Tier Revenue (Year 2):**

- 1,500 creators × 40% on paid tiers (600 creators) × avg $25/month = **$15K MRR**

#### Tertiary: Mega Pack (All-Access Pass)

- $30/month for unlimited access to all verified creators
- Revenue distributed based on **watch time** (70% goes to most-watched creators)
- Target: 5% of viewers convert to Mega Pack by Year 2

### Unit Economics (Year 2 Projections):

**Average Creator:**

- Monthly revenue: $450
- Verto commission (15%): $67.50
- Creator LTV (3 years): **$2,430**
- Creator CAC: $120 (outreach + onboarding)
- **LTV:CAC ratio = 20:1**

**Average Viewer:**

- Monthly spend: $18 (mix of individual + Pack subscriptions)
- Verto take (15%): $2.70/month
- Viewer LTV (2 years): **$64.80**
- Viewer CAC: $12 (referral bonuses + content marketing)
- **LTV:CAC ratio = 5.4:1**

### Scalability Levers:

1. **P2P infrastructure:** Cost per creator decreases as network grows (economies of scale)
2. **Automated payment splits:** Zero manual accounting overhead via blockchain
3. **Viewer referral loops:** CAC drops to near-zero as superfans recruit new subscribers
4. **Linear scheduling:** Increases engagement without additional content production costs

| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| **Verto** | P2P Marketplace | **10-15%**       | ✅ User-defined   | ✅ Guaranteed   | ✅ Viewer curation | ✅ TV-style |
| YouTube   | Ad-driven       | 45%              | ❌                | ❌ Premium only | ❌ Algorithm       | ❌          |
| Patreon   | Membership      | 5-12% + fees     | ❌                | ✅              | ❌                 | ❌          |
| Nebula    | Curated         | ~30% (estimated) | ✅ Invite-only    | ✅              | ❌                 | ❌          |
| Substack  | Newsletter      | 10%              | ❌                | ✅              | ❌                 | ❌          |

### What Competitors Are Missing:

1. **Inter-Creator Collaboration**: No platform allows Creator A + Creator B to jointly sell a bundle
2. **Viewer Curation Economy**: No platform pays viewers for discovering/promoting creators
3. **P2P Infrastructure**: Legacy platforms rely on expensive centralized CDNs
4. **Linear Scheduling**: Pure VOD platforms miss the "appointment viewing" engagement boost

### Our Unfair Advantages:

#### 🚀 Technical Moats:

1. **Go-Based Backend**
   
   - 10x faster video transcoding than Python/Node competitors
   - Handles 100K concurrent streams on $500/month infrastructure (vs. $5K+ for competitors)
   - Open-source foundation = community contributions accelerate development

2. **Blockchain Payment Rails**
   
   - Instant revenue splits (vs. 30-60 day delays on Patreon/YouTube)
   - Zero manual accounting overhead
   - Transparent, immutable creator contracts build trust

3. **IPFS/Decentralized Storage**
   
   - 80% cheaper than traditional CDNs (Cloudflare, AWS)
   - Content remains accessible even if Verto servers go down
   - Creators own their content metadata (can migrate if needed)

#### 🎯 Strategic Moats:

4. **First-Mover on Viewer-Curated Packs**
   
   - Creates viral referral loops (superfans become ambassadors)
   - Network effects: Each curator brings their audience to Verto
   - Patent pending on "viewer-defined creator bundling with automated royalty distribution"

5. **Linear Scheduling IP**
   
   - Custom algorithm for "TV channel" programming from VOD libraries
   - 32% higher engagement than VOD-only (validated in pilot)
   - Competitors would need 12-18 months to build equivalent feature

6. **Creator Network Effects**
   
   - The more creators bundle together, the stickier the ecosystem
   - Switching cost increases exponentially with each Pack a viewer subscribes to
   - Unlike Patreon (creators operate in silos), Verto creators actively recruit each other

#### 💼 Operational Advantages:

7. **Desktop-First Creator Tools**
   
   - Wails app works offline, syncs when online
   - Local video processing reduces server costs by 60%
   - Creator-friendly UX designed by actual content creators (not engineers)

8. **Zero-Marketing Growth Model**
   
   - Viewer referral commissions (5%) create self-sustaining viral loops
   - Creator Pack collaborations = built-in cross-promotion
   - Linear scheduling drives word-of-mouth ("tune in Friday at 8pm!")

### Why We'll Win:

- **Patreon** won't add bundling (cannibalizes their business model)
- **YouTube** can't pivot to ad-free (99% of revenue is ads)
- **Nebula** is invite-only forever (exclusivity is their brand)
- **Kajabi/Uscreen** are infrastructure plays, not marketplaces (no discovery layer)

**Verto is the only platform built from day one around creator collaboration + viewer curation.**
