## Style Guide


- **Vibrant Minimalist-Tech:** The layout uses ample whitespace and a clean "Inter" font to ensure readability, while the "Bricolage Grotesque" header font adds a bold, personality-driven "Swiss-style" edge.
    
- **High-Energy Color Theory:** The primary palette relies on a high-contrast **#FF4D24 (Vibrant Orange)** against a **#0D0D0D (Deep Charcoal)** and **#FDFBFB (Soft White)** base. This creates a sense of urgency and "blockchain speed" without looking cluttered.
    
- **Glassmorphism & Soft Geometrics:** The design uses large border radii (up to **48px**) and backdrop-blur effects ("glass-strips") to create depth. The floating 3D sphere serves as a focal point to break the "flatness" of standard web design.
    
- **Bento-Grid Logic:** The "Problem/Solution" section uses a structured grid that makes complex information (platform taxes, discovery issues) scannable at a glance.
